Practice Quiz - Self-Reflection: Collecting data Review 
Review Learning Objectives
In this activity, you will use what you learned about the data life cycle in a mock interview for a data analyst role at an ice cream company. 
Instructions
 
Read the scenario below and then share your response in the reflection section.  
You are interviewing for a data analyst role at a local ice cream company. They are interested in using data on customer ice cream flavor preferences to help drive important decisions. 
The hiring manager asks you:
“We want to better understand our customers’ ice cream flavor preferences, but honestly we don’t even know where to start. Would you explain how you would approach this if you were part of our team?”
Reflection
 
Before responding to the hiring manager’s question, consider each step of the data life cycle: 
•	Plan - What plans and decisions do you need to make? What data do you need to answer your question?
•	Capture - Where does your data come from? How will you get it?
•	Manage - How will you store your data? What should it be used for, and how do you keep this data secure and protected?
•	Analyze - How will the company analyze the data? What tools should they use?
•	Archive - What should they do with their data when it gets old? How do they know when it's time?
•	Destroy - Should they ever dispose of any data? If so, when and how?
In the text box below, write 5-10 sentences explaining your recommendations for collecting customer flavor preference data. 
Here are some topics to consider for your response: 
•	What kind of data should they be gathering? 
•	How should they gather this data? 
•	Where will the data live? How will they store the data?
•	Once they have the data, how will they use it? 
•	How do they keep their data secure and protected? 
•	What should they do with old data? What are their options?
